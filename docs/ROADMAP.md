# clip.sh roadmap

Where clip.sh goes from "works on my KDE box" to a clipping app people
choose over ShadowPlay, Medal and Steam Game Recording: on Linux first, then
Windows. This is a working document; strike things out rather than deleting
them so the reasoning stays.

Research notes behind the choices are in [Sources](#sources) at the end.

## 1. What we are competing with

| | ShadowPlay / NVIDIA App | Medal | Steam Game Recording | clip.sh today |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Platforms | Windows, NVIDIA only | Windows, mobile | Windows, Linux, Deck | Linux (Wayland) |
| Instant replay | yes | yes | yes (background mode) | yes |
| Hardware encode | NVENC | NVENC / AMF / QSV, CPU | yes | NVENC / VA-API / x264 |
| Codecs | H.264 / HEVC / AV1 | H.264 / HEVC / AV1 | H.264 | H.264 / HEVC / AV1 |
| Game detection | yes | yes, plus event detection | Steam games only | Steam app id / Wine exe |
| Event markers | no | game events (kills, wins) | timeline: achievements, screenshots, dev SDK | no |
| Editor | trim | trim, slow-mo, zoom, overlays, multi-track mix | trim, export | trim, multi-track mix |
| Sharing | file | instant upload, links, privacy, mobile sync | Steam share | "Show in folder" |
| Library | basic | search, labels, sort, cloud | per-game timeline | per-game, search, sort |
| Prompt-free window capture on Wayland | n/a | n/a | overlay-based | KDE only |

The gap that matters: Steam's recorder is free, cross-platform and already
on Linux. clip.sh wins by being lighter, desktop-wide (not just Steam games),
GPU-encoded at native refresh rates, and by having the best editor and
library of the three. Medal's social layer is a different business; we can
match its *local* feature set without a backend.

## 2. Design principles (what "attractive" means here)

Taken from current dark-theme guidance and the apps gamers already use:

1. **Dark grey, never pure black, with elevation by tint.** Surfaces step
   from `#0d0d0f` (canvas) to `#17181b` (panel) to `#1e1f23` (raised); depth
   comes from lighter surfaces, not drop shadows. Already true; keep it.
2. **One desaturated accent, user-selectable.** The accent is the only
   saturated colour on screen. Bright orange on dark can glare, so the
   palette offers six accents (Appearance settings) and every accent-coloured
   surface derives from the one CSS variable.
3. **Dark mode is its own design, not an inversion.** There is no light
   theme and there will not be one until the app has a reason; gaming
   tools (Steam, Medal, Discord) are dark-only and users expect it.
4. **Meet WCAG AA contrast.** Body text `zinc-100` on panel is ~14:1,
   muted text `#8b8d96` on canvas is ~5.6:1. Any new colour must stay above
   4.5:1 for text and 3:1 for icons.
5. **Respect the OS.** Reduced-motion is honoured automatically
   (`prefers-reduced-motion`) with an in-app override, window size and
   position are remembered, and the system file manager, trash and
   notification service are used rather than reimplemented.
6. **Keyboard first.** Every viewer action has a key and the list is one
   keystroke away (`?`). Library search is `Ctrl+F`, selection is `Esc` to
   cancel and `Delete` to delete.
7. **Undo over confirm.** Destructive actions happen immediately in the UI
   and can be undone for six seconds, instead of a modal asking "Are you
   sure?". Clips also go to the desktop trash by default.
8. **Content is the hero.** Game art fills the top of the Games page,
   thumbnails fill cards, previews play on hover. Chrome stays muted so the
   clips carry the colour.

## 3. Done in this pass

- Library: search (`Ctrl+F`), sort (newest / oldest / longest / largest),
  game filter, selection mode with bulk delete and a size readout.
- Clip cards play a muted preview on hover (Medal's "quick clip previews").
- Deletes are deferred six seconds with **Undo** in the toast; the UI hides
  the clip at once.
- Viewer: playback speed (0.25–2×), frame stepping (`,` `.`), `J`/`L`
  10-second jumps, `Home`/`End`, repeat (`R`), `T` toggles trim, and a `?`
  shortcut sheet.
- Appearance settings: accent colour, card density, hover previews, reduced
  motion. Stored per machine in `localStorage`.
- First-run page is a setup checklist (capture state, hotkey, clips folder)
  with the fix one click away.
- Window size and position persist (`tauri-plugin-window-state`).
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): svelte-check, Vite build, `cargo fmt`,
  `clippy -D warnings`, `cargo test` on Ubuntu with GStreamer installed.
- Release workflow (`release.yml`): AppImage, deb and rpm from a `v*` tag
  through `tauri-action`, as a draft release. Windows job is written and
  commented out.
- AUR `PKGBUILD` and a `.desktop` entry under `packaging/`.
- Favourites, labels and titles, stored in each clip's `.mp4.json` sidecar.
  Star on cards and in the viewer (`S`), rename inline (`N`), add and
  remove labels in the viewer; the Clips page filters by favourite and
  label, and search matches titles and labels.

## 4. Feature roadmap

Phases are ordered by user value per engineering day. Each phase should
ship on its own.

### Phase 1 — Library you can live in (next)

- ~~**Favourites and labels.**~~ Done. Stored in the `<clip>.mp4.json`
  sidecar so the folder stays the source of truth and survives sync tools.
- ~~**Rename / title.**~~ Done.
- **Bulk label / favourite** from selection mode, and label autocompletion
  from labels already in use.
- **Timeline scrubbing on hover.** Generate a 10×1 sprite of frames per clip
  alongside the thumbnail (`clip_core::media::inspect` already decodes one
  frame; take ten). Hover position maps to a sprite frame; cheaper than the
  video preview and works for clips the webview cannot decode.
- **Screenshots.** A second hotkey saves a PNG of the current frame from the
  ring buffer. Medal and Steam both have it; it is nearly free given the
  buffer.
- **Game page polish.** Session list ("Played 2h 14m on Tuesday, 3 clips"),
  jump to a session's clips.

### Phase 2 — Editor worth opening

- **Multi-clip export / "montage".** Select clips, order them, render one
  file. GStreamer `concat` over the existing `export::render`.
- **Slow motion and speed ramps** per selected range (`videorate` + audio
  `pitch`/`scaletempo`). Medal's most-used effect.
- **Crop / zoom** with a draggable rectangle on the preview (`videocrop`
  + `videoscale`).
- **Export presets:** Discord (25 MB / 10 MB cap: two-pass bitrate from
  duration), 9:16 vertical with the crop above, GIF (`gifenc` via libav).
- **Audio**: per-track mute buttons on the timeline, waveform strip under
  the trim track (`level` element at inspect time, cached next to the
  thumbnail).
- **Markers.** Press a second hotkey while playing to drop a marker into the
  buffer; saved into the sidecar; shown as ticks on the timeline. This is
  the manual half of Steam's timeline and the foundation for event
  detection.

### Phase 3 — Capture quality

- **Zero-copy capture** on NVIDIA (`cudaupload` / DMA-BUF into NVENC) and
  VA-API (`vapostproc` with DMA-BUF import). Fixes the stutter under GPU
  load noted in the README.
- **`ext-image-copy-capture-v1`** for prompt-free window capture on wlroots
  (Hyprland, Sway, niri) now that compositors ship it.
- **X11** via `ximagesrc` as a fallback backend with `xdotool`-style active
  window tracking.
- **Audio per application** through PipeWire node targeting (record the
  game, not Discord), with Discord as its own optional track.
- **Replay length up to 20 min** with the ring spilling to disk (`splitmuxsink`
  style segments) above a RAM budget.
- **Overlay-free "clip saved" toast** rendered by the compositor is not
  possible on Wayland; keep the notification and sound, add a tray icon
  flash.

### Phase 4 — Share

- **Copy to clipboard** as a file (`text/uri-list`) so a clip can be pasted
  into Discord/Slack/Matrix.
- **"Share to…"** sheet using the desktop's share portal when available.
- **Optional uploads** to a user-chosen destination (S3-compatible, Nextcloud
  WebDAV, a self-hosted clip.sh server later). No clip.sh cloud; users bring
  their own.
- **Game event detection** (Medal-style) is deliberately last: it needs
  per-game log parsing or vision models, and markers + hotkeys cover 80%.

## 5. Platforms

### Windows (the big one)

The frontend, library, settings, storage and trimmer are already
platform-neutral. The work is in `crates/clip-core` and a few spots in
`app/src-tauri`. GStreamer is the right choice on Windows too: it has
first-party Windows Graphics Capture, WASAPI loopback and all three vendor
encoders, so the ring buffer, save and export code is reused unchanged.

**Capture.** `d3d12screencapturesrc capture-api=wgc` (GStreamer ≥ 1.26)
captures a monitor or a specific window (HWND) through the Windows Graphics
Capture API with the frame staying on the GPU. `d3d11screencapturesrc` with
WGC exists from 1.22 but a known bug distorts window capture when paired
with `mfh264enc`; prefer the D3D12 element and `d3d12download`/`d3d12convert`
only when an encoder needs system memory. WGC needs Windows 10 1809+; the
yellow capture border is removable on Windows 11 only.

**Encoders.** Probe in this order and reuse the existing "test-encode once"
logic: `nvd3d12h264enc` / `nvh264enc` (NVIDIA), `amfh264enc` (AMD),
`qsvh264enc` (Intel), `d3d12h264enc` (vendor-neutral, Windows 11), then
`mfh264enc` (Media Foundation, any GPU), then `x264enc`. Same for HEVC and
AV1 variants. `Encoder` gains `Amf`, `Qsv`, `MediaFoundation` variants;
`quality.ts` labels follow.

**Audio.** `wasapi2src loopback=true` for desktop audio and plain
`wasapi2src` for the mic; `loopback-mode=exclude-process-tree` with the
game's PID is available (Windows 10 build 20348+) when per-app audio lands.

**Game detection.** Replace `/proc` scanning with `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot`
(or the `sysinfo` crate) plus the foreground window's PID. Steam games are
identified by the `SteamAppId` environment variable of the process, or by
matching the exe path against `steamapps/*.acf` under the library folders
from `HKCU\Software\Valve\Steam\SteamPath`. Non-Steam games: a fullscreen
or borderless foreground window whose process is not on a denylist, same
heuristic as today's Wine `.exe` path.

**Hotkeys.** `global-hotkey` (what `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut` wraps)
uses `RegisterHotKey`, which fires over borderless-fullscreen games and most
exclusive-fullscreen ones; keep `clipsh save` + the IPC socket (named pipe
on Windows) as the fallback.

**Hard parts, in order.**

1. `clip-core` compiles on Windows: gate `kwin`, `portal`, `hotkey`
   (ashpd), `display` (Wayland) and `game` (`/proc`) behind
   `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]`, move `wayland-*`, `ashpd`, `zbus` to
   `[target.'cfg(target_os = "linux")'.dependencies]`, and introduce a
   `platform` module with `CaptureBackend`, `GameWatcher`, `HotkeyService`
   traits implemented per OS. The app crate's `system.rs` (D-Bus
   notifications, freedesktop sounds) and `ipc_server.rs` (Unix socket) get
   Windows counterparts (`tauri-plugin-notification`, `windows::Media`
   `SystemSounds`, named pipes).
2. Playback in WebView2: H.264 plays, HEVC needs the HEVC Video Extension
   from the Store, AV1 needs the AV1 extension and is still flaky. The
   viewer already streams from our loopback media server; add a
   "transcode a proxy for preview" fallback (`decodebin ! x264enc` at low
   bitrate into the cache) when the webview reports it cannot play a codec.
3. Packaging: `tauri-action` on `windows-latest` builds NSIS/MSI; bundle
   GStreamer's MSVC runtime (`gstreamer-1.0-msvc-x86_64` ~ 150 MB
   trimmed to the plugins we use) via `bundle.resources` and set
   `GST_PLUGIN_PATH` at startup. Sign with an EV cert eventually; until then
   SmartScreen will warn.

Estimated size: two to three weeks for a first alpha on NVIDIA, with the CI
matrix entry in `ci.yml` and the commented job in `release.yml` switched on.

### macOS (later)

ScreenCaptureKit via GStreamer's `avfvideosrc` (`capture-screen=true`) or a
thin Swift bridge, `vtenc_h264_hw` / `vtenc_h265_hw` encoders,
`osxaudiosrc` with an aggregate device or a loopback driver for desktop
audio (there is no system loopback API before macOS 13's
`CATap`). Fewer gamers, but the Tauri and GStreamer story is the same, and
the editor alone is useful. Do it after Windows is stable.

### Steam Deck

Already Linux/KDE; the KWin path works in desktop mode. Game mode uses
Gamescope, which does not expose the KWin protocol: add a Gamescope-aware
backend using the portal with the restore token (already supported) and a
Decky plugin or Steam Input binding for the hotkey. Low effort, high
visibility.

## 6. Engineering foundations

- **Frontend tests.** Vitest for `format.ts`, `quality.ts` and the sort /
  filter logic in `ClipsView` (extract to `library.ts`); Playwright smoke
  test with the Tauri bridge mocked (the mock in
  `app/tests/mock-tauri.ts` can start from the screenshot harness used to
  review this pass).
- **Rust tests.** `ring.rs`, `save.rs`, `game.rs` have tests; add
  `export::render` round trips with `videotestsrc` in CI (GStreamer is
  installed there now).
- **Crash and log capture.** `tracing` to a rolling file under the cache
  dir; "Copy diagnostics" button in Settings → General.
- **Auto-update.** `tauri-plugin-updater` once releases are signed; AppImage
  and the Windows installer support it, AUR/Flatpak do not need it.
- **Telemetry: none.** The ad slot stays off by default and opt-in.

## 7. Packaging & distribution

| Channel | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AppImage / deb / rpm | release workflow | Built on Ubuntu 22.04 for glibc reach |
| AUR (`clip-sh`) | PKGBUILD ready | Publish after the first tagged release |
| Flathub | later | Needs `--socket=pipewire`, `--talk-name=org.kde.KWin`; wait for the portal path to be default |
| Windows NSIS / MSI | after port | Bundle GStreamer runtime; code signing |
| winget / Scoop | after port | Manifests are trivial once the installer exists |
| Homebrew cask | after macOS | |
